B Sc Grads = Rs x/-
Engg Grads = Rs y/-

    SELECT EMP_LOC, ENP_DESN, EMP_EARN, EMP_DEDN
    FROM  T01_EMPLOYEE-tABLE

Create the following 2 Tables -
1) Location Table - as before
2) Employee Table - as below
   CREATE TABLE T01_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
   (EMP_ID CHAR(5) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    EMP_NAME   CHAR(15) ,
    EMP_LOC CHAR(3),
    EMP_DESG   SMALLINT,
    EMP_EARN   DECIMAL(7,2),
    EMP_DEDN   DECIMAL(7,2))
    FOREIGN KEY(EMP_LOC) REFERENCES T01_LOCATION_TABLE(LOC_ID)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT)
    IN PATNIDB1.PATNITS1;
3) Location Table has 4 Rows for 'PUN', 'MUM', 'CHN' and 'BGL'
4) Insert Rows into the above Employee Table as below -
   - at least 8 Rows per Location, at least 2 per Designation(1, 2, 3 & 4)
   There should be a minimum of 32 Rows in the Employee Table
Program Specifications =
1) Accept Increment Percentages per Designation for a Location from the User
2) Update the Earnings & Deductions as -
  Earnings = Earnings + Increment Percentage
  Deductions   = 10% of New Earnings
++++++++++++
User Input will be given as follows -
//SYSIN DD *
LOCN1N2N3N4N5
/*
where LOC = Location Code
      N1  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 1
      N2  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 2
      N3  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 3
      N4  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 4
      N5  = Increment Percentage for Designation = Other
